This test commit is not added to the base branch or the head branch. You can review the status of the test commit using the `mergeable` key.

If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.

Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:
     *
     * *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.

     * *   If [rebased](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

     * Create a review comment for a pull request

     * Creates a review comment in the pull request diff. To add a regular comment to a pull request timeline, see "[Create an issue comment](https://docs.github.com/rest/issues/comments#create-an-issue-comment)." We recommend creating a review comment using `line`, `side`, and optionally `start_line` and `start_side` if your comment applies to more than one line in the pull request diff.
     *
     * The `position` parameter is deprecated. If you use `position`, the `line`, `side`, `start_line`, and `start_side` parameters are not required.
     *
     * **Note:** The position value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.

     * Create a review for a pull request
     * This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.
     *
     * Pull request reviews created in the `PENDING` state are not submitted and therefore do not include the `submitted_at` property in the response. To create a pending review for a pull request, leave the `event` parameter blank. For more information about submitting a `PENDING` review, see "[Submit a review for a pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/reviews#submit-a-review-for-a-pull-request)."
     *
     * **Note:** To comment on a specific line in a file, you need to first determine the _position_ of that line in the diff. The GitHub REST API offers the `application/vnd.github.v3.diff` [media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests). To see a pull request diff, add this media type to the `Accept` header of a call to the [single pull request](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request) endpoint.
     *
     * The `position` value equals the number of lines down from the first "@@" hunk header in the file you want to add a comment. The line just below the "@@" line is position 1, the next line is position 2, and so on. The position in the diff continues to increase through lines of whitespace and additional hunks until the beginning of a new file.
