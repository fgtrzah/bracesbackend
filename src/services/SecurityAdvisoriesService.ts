     * List global security advisories
     * Lists all global security advisories that match the specified parameters. If no other parameters are defined, the request will return only GitHub-reviewed advisories that are not malware.
     *
     * By default, all responses will exclude advisories for malware, because malware are not standard vulnerabilities. To list advisories for malware, you must include the `type` parameter in your request, with the value `malware`. For more information about the different types of security advisories, see "[About the GitHub Advisory database](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database#about-types-of-security-advisories)."
     * @param ghsaId If specified, only advisories with this GHSA (GitHub Security Advisory) identifier will be returned.
     * @param type If specified, only advisories of this type will be returned. By default, a request with no other parameters defined will only return reviewed advisories that are not malware.
     * @param cveId If specified, only advisories with this CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifier will be returned.
     * @param ecosystem If specified, only advisories for these ecosystems will be returned.
     * @param severity If specified, only advisories with these severities will be returned.
     * @param cwes If specified, only advisories with these Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) will be returned.
     *
     * Example: `cwes=79,284,22` or `cwes[]=79&cwes[]=284&cwes[]=22`
     * @param isWithdrawn Whether to only return advisories that have been withdrawn.
     * @param affects If specified, only return advisories that affect any of `package` or `package@version`. A maximum of 1000 packages can be specified.
     * If the query parameter causes the URL to exceed the maximum URL length supported by your client, you must specify fewer packages.
     *
     * Example: `affects=package1,package2@1.0.0,package3@^2.0.0` or `affects[]=package1&affects[]=package2@1.0.0`
     * @param published If specified, only return advisories that were published on a date or date range.
     *
     * For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."
     * @param updated If specified, only return advisories that were updated on a date or date range.
     *
     * For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."
     * @param modified If specified, only show advisories that were updated or published on a date or date range.
     *
     * For more information on the syntax of the date range, see "[Understanding the search syntax](https://docs.github.com/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#query-for-dates)."

     * @param after A cursor, as given in the [Link header](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api#using-link-headers). If specified, the query only searches for results after this cursor.
