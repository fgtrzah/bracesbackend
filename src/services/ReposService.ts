     * Add a repository collaborator
     * This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in secondary rate limiting. See "[Secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#secondary-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with secondary rate limits](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/best-practices-for-integrators#dealing-with-secondary-rate-limits)" for details.
     *
     * Adding an outside collaborator may be restricted by enterprise administrators. For more information, see "[Enforcing repository management policies in your enterprise](https://docs.github.com/admin/policies/enforcing-policies-for-your-enterprise/enforcing-repository-management-policies-in-your-enterprise#enforcing-a-policy-for-inviting-outside-collaborators-to-repositories)."
     *
     * For more information on permission levels, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://docs.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization)". There are restrictions on which permissions can be granted to organization members when an organization base role is in place. In this case, the permission being given must be equal to or higher than the org base permission. Otherwise, the request will fail with:
     *
     * ```
     * Cannot assign {member} permission of {role name}
     * ```
     *
     * Note that, if you choose not to pass any parameters, you'll need to set `Content-Length` to zero when calling out to this endpoint. For more information, see "[HTTP verbs](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#http-verbs)."
     *
     * The invitee will receive a notification that they have been invited to the repository, which they must accept or decline. They may do this via the notifications page, the email they receive, or by using the [API](https://docs.github.com/rest/collaborators/invitations).
     *
     * **Updating an existing collaborator's permission level**
     *
     * The endpoint can also be used to change the permissions of an existing collaborator without first removing and re-adding the collaborator. To change the permissions, use the same endpoint and pass a different `permission` parameter. The response will be a `204`, with no other indication that the permission level changed.
     *
     * **Rate limits**
     *
     * You are limited to sending 50 invitations to a repository per 24 hour period. Note there is no limit if you are inviting organization members to an organization repository.

     * - Cancels any outstanding invitations
     * - Unasigns the user from any issues
     * - Removes access to organization projects if the user is not an organization member and is not a collaborator on any other organization repositories.
     * - Unstars the repository
     * - Updates access permissions to packages
     *
     * Removing a user as a collaborator has the following effects on forks:
     * - If the user had access to a fork through their membership to this repository, the user will also be removed from the fork.
     * - If the user had their own fork of the repository, the fork will be deleted.
     * - If the user still has read access to the repository, open pull requests by this user from a fork will be denied.

     * Although the API responds immediately, the additional permission updates might take some extra time to complete in the background.

     * - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.
     * - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.

     *
     * Files and symlinks support [a custom media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/media-types) for
     * retrieving the raw content or rendered HTML (when supported). All content types support [a custom media

     * object format.
     *
     * **Notes**:
     * *   To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
     * *   This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees
     * API](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
     * *  Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.
     * Size limits:
     * If the requested file's size is:
     * * 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
     * * Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` [custom media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents#custom-media-types-for-repository-contents) are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.
     * * Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.
     *
     * If the content is a directory:
     * The response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.
     * When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value
     * _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW).
     * In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".
     *
     * If the content is a symlink:
     * If the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the
     * API responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object
     * describing the symlink itself.
     *
     * If the content is a submodule:
     * The `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific
     * commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out
     * the submodule at that specific commit.
     *
     * If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the

    /**
     * Create a deployment
     * Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.
     *
     * The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them
     * before we merge a pull request.
     *
     * The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
     * multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
     * makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.
     *
     * The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
     * the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
     * the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
     * return a failure response.
     *
     * By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
     * state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
     * specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
     * not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.
     *
     * The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
     * field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.
     *
     * The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
     * be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
     * application with debugging enabled.
     *
     * Users with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.
     *
     * Merged branch response:
     *
     * You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
     * a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
     * *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
     * *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
     * *   There are no merge conflicts
     *
     * If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
     * response.
     *
     * Merge conflict response:
     *
     * This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
     * be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.
     *
     * Failed commit status checks:
     *
     * This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
     * status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

     * Upload a release asset
     * This endpoint makes use of [a Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
     * the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.
     *
     * You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.
     *
     * Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example:
     *
     * `application/zip`
     *
     * GitHub expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
     * you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.
     *
     * When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.
     *
     * **Notes:**
     * *   GitHub renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List release assets](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"
     * endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).
     * *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release).
     * *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.
     * @param owner The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive.
